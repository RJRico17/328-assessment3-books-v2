I couldnt get it to work because theres a few parts I dont understand how to do but I'll write this so maybe you can see where my thinking was even though I didnt know a few parts

I was having trouble figuring out postman and getting my `res.status(200).send(JSON.stringify(reviews))` to work because I knew I had to change it from JS obj to JSON in order to send it but I was having trouble with it but had I been able to I would have then =>

Write a fetch and .then .then, it only got a little challenging trying to create HTML markup but I know I should use innerHTML after dcoument.getElementById('review-list') and for every entry of books add it to the review-list.

After that it wouldve been as simple as writing the correct routes for displaying the home as HTML and linking the JS file to it so it uses the fetch and api call to render the books.

Couldnt get it to work, I have some work done and like i said my thinking here so you know im not completely stupid. Otherwise thanks for the quarter!
